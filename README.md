# The People's Dashboard

The people’s dashboard is intended to be a critical layer on top of six different social media platforms: YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LastFM, LinkedIn, and Instagram. For each of these platforms the following features are highlighted: navigation, platform, people and mix. In order to discover people’s data, an interface analysis was performed by collecting the language and all elements from the various platforms.

More info can be found on our [wiki](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/PeoplesDashboard).

Currently the People's Dashboard is only implemented for Facebook.
