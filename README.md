# The People's Dashboard

The people’s dashboard is intended to be a critical layer on top of six different social media platforms: YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, LastFM, LinkedIn, and Instagram. For each of these platforms the following features are highlighted: navigation, platform, people and mix. In order to discover people’s data, an interface analysis was performed by collecting the language and all elements from the various platforms.

# User script

The People's dashboard is implemented as a user script which can be installed in [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox) or [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) (Chrome). Currently only the People's Dashboard is only implemented for Facebook.
